# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Custom roles & teams migration** (opt-in workflow steps):
  - `extract-account` — download user-created custom roles and teams to `data/launchdarkly-migrations/source/account/`
  - `migrate-roles` — create or update custom roles in the destination (policy project-key remapping, conflict prefix, dry-run)
  - `migrate-teams` — create teams with remapped member IDs (requires `map-members` mapping file)
  - Shared utilities in `src/utils/account_iam.ts` and example [`examples/workflow-account-iam.yaml`](examples/workflow-account-iam.yaml)
  - Deno tasks: `extract-account`, `migrate-roles`, `migrate-teams`

## [3.1.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- **Include / exclude flags**: Migrate only specific flags or skip others
  - `migration.includeFlags` (YAML array or `--include-flags` comma-separated): only these flag keys are migrated
  - `migration.excludeFlags` (YAML array or `--exclude-flags` comma-separated): these flag keys are skipped
  - Supported in workflow YAMLs and in the migrate task (CLI and config file)
- **Parallel flag migration**: Migrate up to N flags at a time (default 10)
  - `migration.concurrency` in workflow YAML or `--concurrency N` for the migrate task
  - Speeds up migration by processing multiple flags concurrently; rate limiting still applies

### Fixed

- **Flag keys that differ only by case now migrate as separate flags**
  Extract now writes each flag's data to an index-prefixed file (`flags/0-my-flag.json`, `flags/1-other-flag.json`, ...) instead of using just the flag key as the filename. On case-insensitive filesystems (e.g. macOS default), keys like `Flag-one` and `flag-one` no longer overwrite the same file, while remaining human-browsable. Migrate tries the index-prefixed path first and falls back to pure index, SHA-based, and plain key paths, so existing extractions continue to work.

## [3.0.2] - 2025-12-09

### Fixed
- **Segment Pagination**: Fixed segment extraction being limited to 50 segments per environment
  - Previously relied on `_links.next` which wasn't consistently returned by the API
  - Now uses `totalCount` from API response to properly paginate through all segments
  - Improved progress logging to show actual fetched range (e.g., "Fetched segments 1 to 50 of 500")

### Changed
- **Smart Rate Limiting**: Enhanced rate limit handling using HTTP response headers
  - Reads `x-ratelimit-global-remaining`, `x-ratelimit-route-remaining`, and `x-ratelimit-reset` headers
  - Proactive throttling when remaining requests fall below threshold (avoids hitting 429s)
  - Intelligent delay calculation that spreads requests across the reset window
  - Proper backoff on 429 responses using `retry-after` or `x-ratelimit-reset` headers
  - Per-route rate limit tracking for more accurate throttling
  - Added jitter to prevent thundering herd issues

## [3.0.1] - 2025-01-14

### Changed
- **License**: Migrated from MIT License to Apache 2.0 License for LaunchDarkly Labs compliance
- **README**: Updated license badge and added LaunchDarkly Labs disclaimer
- **Repository**: Added comprehensive topics including migrations, migration-tools, and LaunchDarkly Labs tags

## [3.0.0] - 2025-10-13

### Added
- **Workflow Orchestrator**: Complete end-to-end migration automation from a single YAML config file
  - Runs full workflow (extract → map → migrate) by default when no steps specified
  - Selective step execution for custom workflows
  - Support for extract-only, migrate-only, and third-party import workflows
  - Revert workflow to undo migrations
- **Views Support**: Automatic extraction, creation, and linking of LaunchDarkly Views (Early Access feature)
  - Discovers and preserves view associations from source flags
  - Creates missing views in the destination project
  - Optional target view linkage for all migrated flags
- **YAML Configuration File Support**: Full YAML-based configuration for migrate task
  - Alternative to CLI arguments for better maintainability
  - Version control friendly
  - CLI arguments override config file values
  - Multiple example configs for different scenarios
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatic handling of resource key conflicts
  - Configurable prefix for conflicting resources
  - Automatic retry with prefix on HTTP 409 conflicts
  - Detailed conflict resolution reporting
  - Applies to flags, segments, and other resources
- **Environment Mapping**: Map source environment keys to different destination keys
  - Support for projects with different naming conventions (e.g., prod → production)
  - Validation of mapped environments before migration
  - Works with both flags and segments
- **Environment Filtering**: Selective migration of specific environments
  - Comma-separated list of environments to migrate
  - Useful for testing and staged migrations
- **Multi-Region and Custom Instance Support**: Configure LaunchDarkly domains for different instances
  - US instance (app.launchdarkly.com) - default
  - EU instance (app.eu.launchdarkly.com)
  - Custom/on-premise instances
  - Domain configuration via CLI flags or YAML config
- **Revert Migration Capability**: Undo previously executed migrations
  - Delete migrated flags and segments
  - Optional view cleanup after unlinking
  - Dry-run mode for previewing changes
  - Selective revert of specific resources
- **Idempotent Migration Operations**: Safe re-running of migrations
  - Skips existing resources instead of failing
  - Creates approval requests when environments require them
  - Handles beta API endpoints gracefully
- **Approval Request Support**: Automatic creation of approval requests for protected environments
  - Detects environments that don't allow direct patching
  - Creates approval requests with proper variation IDs
  - Prevents duplicate approval requests

### Changed
- **Major refactoring** of migration script for improved maintainability and modularity
- Enhanced logging throughout workflow and migration processes
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Better handling of beta API endpoints
- Segments are now only extracted when explicitly needed (via `extraction.includeSegments` or `migration.migrateSegments`)

### Fixed
- Dry-run mode now correctly validates without making changes
- Fixed handling of environments with approval requirements
