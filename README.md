Set of scripts intended for migrating LaunchDarkly projects between different accounts, regions, or instances. The supported resources include: environments, flags, segments, and maintainer mappings.

## Overview

These scripts helps you migrate your LaunchDarkly projects across different scenarios:

- **Account Mergers**: Consolidating projects from multiple accounts into a single account
- **Project Splitting**: Breaking up large projects into smaller, more manageable ones
- **Region Migrations**: Moving projects between US-hosted (app.launchdarkly.com) and EU-hosted (app.eu.launchdarkly.com) accounts
- **Instance Migrations**: Moving projects between different LaunchDarkly instances
- **Environment Consolidation**: Merging environments across projects
- **Resource Reorganization**: Restructuring flags and segments across projects

Features that are currently supported:

- Project & environment configuration and settings
- Feature flags and their configurations
- Segments and targeting rules
- Maintainer mapping across different account instances
- **Views support**: Automatic extraction and creation of views with flag linkage
- **Conflict resolution**: Automatic handling of resource key conflicts with configurable prefixes

## Documentation

- **[Migration guide (extract, migrate, revert)](docs/migration-guide.md)** – Step-by-step walkthrough of the export, migrate, and revert process, with include flags, parameters, and YAML reference.

## Multi-Region and Custom Instance Support

All scripts support configurable LaunchDarkly domains to work with different instances and regions:

- **US Instance** (default): `app.launchdarkly.com`
- **EU Instance**: `app.eu.launchdarkly.com`
- **Custom instances**: Any custom LaunchDarkly domain

### How to Configure Domains

**Via YAML configuration files** (recommended):
```yaml
source:
  projectKey: my-project
  domain: app.launchdarkly.com  # Default if not specified

destination:
  projectKey: eu-project
  domain: app.eu.launchdarkly.com  # EU instance
```

**Via CLI flags**:
```bash
# Source extraction with custom domain
deno task source -p my-project --domain app.launchdarkly.com

# Migration with different domains
deno task migrate -p us-project -d eu-project --domain app.eu.launchdarkly.com

# Map members between different instances
deno task map-members --source-domain app.launchdarkly.com --dest-domain app.eu.launchdarkly.com
```

**Use cases**:
- Migrating from US to EU instance
- Moving between different LaunchDarkly environments (production vs. sandbox)
- Working with custom or on-premise LaunchDarkly instances

## Prerequisites

- [Deno](https://deno.land/) **2.0.0 or higher** installed
  - If you use Homebrew: `brew install deno`
- LaunchDarkly API key with appropriate permissions
  - Source account API key with at least Reader access
  - Destination account API key with at least Writer access
- Access to both source and destination LaunchDarkly instances

## Configuration

1. Create a configuration file for your API keys:
   ```bash
   # Copy the example config file
   cp config/api_keys.json.example config/api_keys.json

   # Edit the file with your API keys
   # config/api_keys.json
   {
     "source_account_api_key": "your_source_api_key_here",
     "destination_account_api_key": "your_destination_api_key_here"
   }
   ```

   Note: The `config/api_keys.json` file is ignored by git to prevent accidental
   exposure of API keys.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Workflow Orchestrator (Recommended)

Run the complete migration workflow from a single YAML config file:

```bash
# Run full workflow (extract → map → migrate) - the default
deno task workflow -f examples/workflow-full.yaml

# Or create your own config
cat > my-migration.yaml <<EOF
source:
  projectKey: my-source-project
destination:
  projectKey: my-dest-project
migration:
  assignMaintainerIds: true
  conflictPrefix: "imported-"
  targetView: "migration-2024"
EOF

deno task workflow -f my-migration.yaml
```

**Default behavior**: If you don't specify `workflow.steps`, it runs the **full workflow**:
1. Extract source project data
2. Map members between instances
3. Migrate to destination

To sync **only changes** after an initial migration, see [Incremental Sync (Step-by-Step)](#incremental-sync-step-by-step).

### Option 2: Individual Steps

Or run migration steps individually:

1. **Download Source Project Data**

   Download source project data to `data/launchdarkly-migrations/source/project/SOURCE_PROJECT_KEY/`.

   ```bash
   # Using workflow config (extract only)
   deno task workflow -f examples/workflow-extract-only.yaml

   # Or using individual task
   deno task source-from-ld -p SOURCE_PROJECT_KEY
   ```

2. **Create Member ID Mapping**

   Automatically create a mapping between source and destination member IDs based on email
   addresses.

   ```bash
   # Using workflow (if part of your steps)
   # Included in default workflow

   # Or using individual task
   deno task map-members
   ```

   This will:
   - Fetch all members from both source and destination account instances
   - Match members based on their email addresses
   - Create a mapping file at `data/mappings/maintainer_mapping.json`
   - Show a summary of mapped and unmapped members

3. **(Optional) Estimate Migration Time**

   Before running the migration, you can estimate how long it will take:

   ```bash
   deno task estimate-migration-time -p SOURCE_PROJECT_KEY
   ```

4. **Migrate Project to the Destination account**

   ```bash
   # Using workflow (recommended)
   deno task workflow -f my-migration.yaml

   # Using individual migrate task with config
   deno task migrate -f examples/migration-config.yaml

   # Using CLI arguments
   deno task migrate -p SOURCE_PROJECT_KEY -d DESTINATION_PROJECT_KEY -m
   ```

[Using Deno Tasks](#using-deno-tasks) below.

## Workflow Orchestrator

The workflow orchestrator allows you to run complete end-to-end migrations from a single YAML config file. It supports:

- ✅ **Full workflow automation** - Extract → Map → Migrate in one command
- ✅ **Selective step execution** - Run only the steps you need
- ✅ **Incremental sync** - After an initial full migration, re-run extract + migrate to sync only changed flags, environments, and segments (see [Incremental Sync (Step-by-Step)](#incremental-sync-step-by-step))
- ✅ **Third-party imports** - Import flags from external sources
- ✅ **Default behavior** - Runs full workflow if no steps specified

### Full Workflow (Default)

```yaml
# workflow-full.yaml
# No workflow.steps specified = runs ALL steps by default

source:
  projectKey: us-production

destination:
  projectKey: eu-production

migration:
  assignMaintainerIds: true
  conflictPrefix: "us-"
  targetView: "us-migration-2024"
  environments:
    - production
    - staging
  environmentMapping:
    production: production
    staging: staging
```

```bash
deno task workflow -f workflow-full.yaml
```

**This automatically runs:**
1. `extract-source` - Downloads all project data
2. `map-members` - Creates member ID mappings
3. `migrate` - Runs the migration

### Extract Source Data Only

```yaml
# workflow-extract-only.yaml
workflow:
  steps:
    - extract-source

source:
  projectKey: my-project
```

```bash
deno task workflow -f workflow-extract-only.yaml
```

### Migrate Only (Pre-extracted Data)

```yaml
# workflow-migrate-only.yaml
workflow:
  steps:
    - migrate

source:
  projectKey: my-source-project

destination:
  projectKey: my-dest-project

migration:
  assignMaintainerIds: false  # No map-members step
  conflictPrefix: "imported-"
  targetView: "migration-2024"
```

```bash
deno task workflow -f workflow-migrate-only.yaml
```

### Third-Party Flag Import

```yaml
# workflow-third-party.yaml
workflow:
  steps:
    - third-party-import

thirdPartyImport:
  inputFile: data/third-party-migrations/import-files/my-flags.json
  targetProject: my-project
  dryRun: false
```

```bash
deno task workflow -f workflow-third-party.yaml
```

### Custom Step Combinations

```yaml
# workflow-custom.yaml
workflow:
  steps:
    - extract-source
    - migrate  # Skip map-members

source:
  projectKey: source-project

destination:
  projectKey: dest-project

migration:
  assignMaintainerIds: false  # Must be false when skipping map-members
  environmentMapping:
    prod: production
    dev: development
```

### Incremental Sync (Step-by-Step)

Incremental sync lets you run a full migration once, then later sync **only** the flags, environments, and segments that changed in the source project. Use `workflow-extract-migrate-incremental.yaml` (extract + migrate, no member mapping).

#### Prerequisites

- [Deno](https://deno.land/) 2.0+ installed.
- API keys in `config/api_keys.json` (source and destination).
- Source and destination LaunchDarkly projects (and optionally matching member mapping from a full workflow).

#### Step 1: Initial export (full sync)

Run the full workflow **once** to create the baseline and the sync manifest. The manifest is written to `./data/launchdarkly-migrations/` and is used later to detect what changed.

1. Edit `examples/workflow-full.yaml` with your `source.projectKey`, `destination.projectKey`, and `domain` (if not default).
2. Run:

   ```bash
   deno task workflow -f examples/workflow-full.yaml
   ```

   This runs **extract-source** → **map-members** → **migrate**. The migrate step performs a full migration and writes the sync manifest. You will not see per-flag **UPDATES** blocks during this run (those appear only during incremental sync).

#### Step 2: Make changes in the source project

In the LaunchDarkly UI (or via API), change the source project: edit a flag (on/off, rules, targeting), add a flag, or change segments/environments. Only those changes will be synced in the next step.

#### Step 3: Sync incrementals

Re-extract the source and migrate only what changed.

1. Edit `examples/workflow-extract-migrate-incremental.yaml` with the **same** `source` and `destination` (and domains) as in Step 1.
2. Run:

   ```bash
   deno task workflow -f examples/workflow-extract-migrate-incremental.yaml
   ```

   This runs **extract-source** (overwrites the previous extract with current source data) then **migrate** with `incremental: true`. The migrate step compares against the sync manifest and updates only flags, environments, and segments that changed since the last run.

#### What you'll see

- **Progress:** `[N/M] Processing flag: <key>` for each flag.
- **Unchanged:** Lines like `✓ <key>: unchanged (v...), skipping` and `✓ <env>: unchanged (v...), skipping` for resources that were not modified.
- **Changed (incremental runs only):** For each updated flag/environment, a detailed **UPDATES** block:
  - `UPDATES`
  - `Flag Key: <key>`
  - `Environment: <env>`
  - `Keys: archived, contextTargets, fallthrough, ...`  
  These blocks appear **only** when you run the migrate step with `--incremental` (e.g. via `workflow-extract-migrate-incremental.yaml`); they are not shown during the initial full export.
- **End of run:** A **MIGRATION SUMMARY** (including whether conflicts were encountered) and a **MIGRATION RESULT** box with flags created, flags updated, flags total, and total time. The line *"More detailed changes per flag are logged above"* refers to the UPDATES blocks when running incrementally.

#### Config reference: Extract + Migrate (Incremental)

```yaml
# workflow-extract-migrate-incremental.yaml
workflow:
  steps:
    - extract-source
    - migrate

source:
  projectKey: my-source-project
  domain: app.launchdarkly.com

destination:
  projectKey: my-dest-project
  domain: app.launchdarkly.com

extraction:
  includeSegments: true

migration:
  migrateSegments: true
  assignMaintainerIds: false
  incremental: true   # First run: full sync + create manifest; later runs: sync only changes
```

```bash
deno task workflow -f examples/workflow-extract-migrate-incremental.yaml
```

**Optional:** Set `migration.dryRun: true` in the YAML to preview what would be synced without applying changes to the destination.

### Workflow Configuration Structure

```yaml
workflow:                    # Optional - defaults to full workflow
  steps:                     # List of steps to execute in order
    - extract-source         # Download source project data
    - map-members           # Map member IDs
    - migrate               # Run migration
    - third-party-import    # Or import from external sources

source:                      # Required
  projectKey: string         # Source project key
  domain: string            # Optional: Defaults to app.launchdarkly.com

destination:                 # Required for migrate step
  projectKey: string         # Destination project key
  domain: string            # Optional: Defaults to app.launchdarkly.com

extraction:                  # Optional - controls what data to extract
  includeSegments: boolean   # Set to true to extract segments (default: false)

memberMapping:               # Optional - for map-members step
  outputFile: string         # Where to save mapping file

migration:                   # Optional - for migrate step
  assignMaintainerIds: boolean
  migrateSegments: boolean
  conflictPrefix: string
  targetView: string
  environments: string[]
  environmentMapping:
    sourceEnv: destEnv
  dryRun: boolean           # Preview changes without applying
  incremental: boolean     # Skip unchanged flags/envs/segments (version-based); see Incremental Sync

thirdPartyImport:           # Required for third-party-import step
  inputFile: string          # JSON or CSV file path
  targetProject: string      # Target LD project
  dryRun: boolean           # Validation only
  reportOutput: string      # Optional report path

revert:                     # Optional - for revert step
  dryRun: boolean           # Preview revert without applying
  deleteViews: boolean      # Whether to delete views after unlinking
  viewKeys: string[]        # Specific views to process
```

### Available Steps

- **`extract-source`** - Downloads all data from source project
- **`map-members`** - Creates member ID mappings between instances
- **`migrate`** - Migrates project to destination
- **`third-party-import`** - Imports flags from external JSON/CSV files
- **`revert`** - Reverts a previously executed migration

### Extracted Data Structure

When you run `extract-source`, data is organized as follows:

```
data/launchdarkly-migrations/source/project/{projectKey}/
├── project.json           # Project metadata and environments
├── flags.json            # List of all flag keys
├── flags/                # Individual flag data
│   ├── flag-key-1.json
│   ├── flag-key-2.json
│   └── ...
└── segments/             # Segment data (only if includeSegments: true)
    ├── environment-1.json
    ├── environment-2.json
    └── ...
```

**Note:** Segments are only extracted if:
- `extraction.includeSegments` is explicitly set to `true` OR
- `migration.migrateSegments` is set to `true`

By default, segments are **not** extracted unless explicitly needed, preventing unnecessary API calls and storage.

### Workflow Examples Included

- `examples/workflow-full.yaml` - Complete workflow (default behavior)
- `examples/workflow-extract-only.yaml` - Extract source data only
- `examples/workflow-extract-migrate-incremental.yaml` - Extract + migrate with incremental sync (only changed flags/envs/segments on subsequent runs)
- `examples/workflow-migrate-only.yaml` - Migrate with pre-extracted data
- `examples/workflow-third-party.yaml` - Third-party flag import
- `examples/workflow-custom-steps.yaml` - Custom step combinations

## Configuration File Support (Individual Migrate Task)

**Note:** This section covers config files for the **individual** `migrate` task. For complete workflow automation (recommended), see the [Workflow Orchestrator](#workflow-orchestrator) section above.

For running the migrate step separately with a config file, you can use YAML instead of CLI arguments. This makes migrations more maintainable and allows you to version control your migration configurations.

### Creating a Migration Config File

**Note:** For most users, use workflow configs instead (see [Workflow Orchestrator](#workflow-orchestrator) section).

Create a YAML file for the individual migrate task (e.g., `migration-config.yaml`):

```yaml
# For use with: deno task migrate -f migration-config.yaml
# This assumes you've already extracted source data

source:
  projectKey: my-source-project
  domain: app.launchdarkly.com  # Optional: Defaults to app.launchdarkly.com

destination:
  projectKey: my-destination-project
  domain: app.launchdarkly.com  # Optional: Use app.eu.launchdarkly.com for EU

# Migration settings
migration:
  assignMaintainerIds: true
  migrateSegments: true
  conflictPrefix: "imported-"
  targetView: "migration-2024"
  environments:
    - production
    - staging
  environmentMapping:
    prod: production
    dev: development
    stg: staging
```

### Using Config Files

```bash
# Use config file for all settings
deno task migrate -f migration-config.yaml

# Config file with CLI overrides (CLI takes precedence)
deno task migrate -f config.yaml -c "different-prefix-"

# Combine config file with additional CLI flags
deno task migrate -f config.yaml -v "additional-view"
```

### Example Config Files

The `examples/` directory includes several config file templates:

- **`migration-config.yaml`** - Full example with all options documented
- **`migration-config-simple.yaml`** - Minimal configuration
- **`migration-config-advanced.yaml`** - Complex migration with all features
- **`migration-config-env-mapping.yaml`** - Focus on environment mapping

### Config File Benefits

✅ **Version control** - Store migration configs in git
✅ **Reproducible** - Run the same migration configuration multiple times
✅ **Maintainable** - Easier to manage complex migrations
✅ **Documented** - Self-documenting with YAML comments
✅ **Flexible** - CLI args can override config file values

### Migration Config File Structure

For use with `deno task migrate -f` (not workflow orchestrator):

```yaml
source:
  projectKey: string         # Required: Source project key
  domain: string             # Optional: Defaults to app.launchdarkly.com

destination:
  projectKey: string         # Required: Destination project key
  domain: string             # Optional: Defaults to app.launchdarkly.com

migration:                   # Migration settings
  assignMaintainerIds: boolean          # Default: false
  migrateSegments: boolean              # Default: true
  conflictPrefix: string                # Optional
  targetView: string                    # Optional
  environments: string[]                # Optional, list format
  environmentMapping:                   # Optional, key-value mapping
    sourceEnv: destEnv
    ...
```

### Priority Order

When using both config files and CLI arguments:
1. **CLI arguments** (highest priority)
2. **Config file values**
3. **Default values** (lowest priority)

Example:
```bash
# Config file has: conflictPrefix: "config-"
# CLI override:
deno task migrate -f config.yaml -c "cli-"
# Result: Uses "cli-" (CLI takes precedence)
```

## Advanced Features

### Views Support

The migration script automatically handles LaunchDarkly Views (Early Access feature):

- **Automatic extraction**: Discovers all view associations from source flags
- **View creation**: Creates views in the destination project if they don't exist
- **View linking**: Preserves view associations when creating flags
- **Target view**: Optionally link all migrated flags to a specific view

**Usage examples:**

```bash
# Migrate flags and preserve their view associations
deno task migrate -p SOURCE_PROJECT -d DEST_PROJECT

# Link all migrated flags to a specific view (in addition to source views)
deno task migrate -p SOURCE_PROJECT -d DEST_PROJECT -v my-target-view

# The script will automatically:
# 1. Extract view keys from source flags
# 2. Create missing views in destination
# 3. Link flags to views during creation
```

**Notes:**
- Views are an Early Access feature in LaunchDarkly
- If a view already exists in the destination, it will be reused
- **You can create the intended view in the destination project before migrating** (e.g. in the LaunchDarkly UI); the script will detect it and link flags to it without creating a duplicate
- View associations are preserved from the source project
- The `-v` flag adds an additional view linkage (doesn't replace existing ones)

### Conflict Resolution

When migrating into an existing project, you may encounter resource key conflicts (e.g., a flag with the same key already exists). The conflict resolution feature handles this automatically:

- **Automatic retry**: First attempts to create without prefix, then retries with prefix on conflict (409)
- **Applies to all resources**: Flags, segments, and other resources
- **Detailed tracking**: Logs all conflict resolutions with a summary report
- **Preserves relationships**: Updates all references to use the prefixed keys

**Usage examples:**

```bash
# Migrate with conflict resolution using 'imported-' prefix
deno task migrate -p SOURCE_PROJECT -d DEST_PROJECT -c "imported-"

# Example output when conflicts are detected:
# ⚠ Flag "my-flag" already exists, retrying with prefix...
# Creating flag: imported-my-flag in Project: DEST_PROJECT
# Flag created

# At the end of migration, you'll see a report:
# ============================================================
# CONFLICT RESOLUTION REPORT
# ============================================================
# Total conflicts resolved: 3
#
# Conflicts by resource type:
#   - flag: 2
#   - segment: 1
#
# Conflict resolutions:
#   - flag: "my-flag" → "imported-my-flag"
#   - flag: "feature-x" → "imported-feature-x"
#   - segment: "users-segment" → "imported-users-segment"
# ============================================================
```

**Notes:**
- Only applies when a conflict (HTTP 409) is detected
- The prefix is applied to both the resource key and name
- All related patches and configurations use the prefixed key
- Use a descriptive prefix to easily identify migrated resources (e.g., `migrated-`, `v2-`, `imported-`)

### Environment Mapping

When migrating between projects with **different environment naming conventions**, you can map source environment keys to destination environment keys using the `--env-map` flag:

**Usage examples:**

```bash
# Map prod → production, dev → development
deno task migrate \
  -p source-project \
  -d dest-project \
  --env-map "prod:production,dev:development"

# Map multiple environments with different names
deno task migrate \
  -p legacy-project \
  -d new-project \
  --env-map "prod:production,stg:staging,qa:test"

# Combine with other features
deno task migrate \
  -p source-project \
  -d dest-project \
  --env-map "prod:production" \
  -c "migrated-" \
  -v "legacy-flags"
```

**Example output:**
```
=== Environment Mapping ===
Source → Destination:
  prod → production
  dev → development
  stg → staging
Migrating 3 mapped environment(s)

Reading flag 1 of 50 : my-feature
  Creating flag: my-feature in Project: dest-project
  Flag created
  Finished patching flag my-feature for env production
  Finished patching flag my-feature for env development
  Finished patching flag my-feature for env staging
```

**How it works:**
1. Reads flag configurations from **source** environments (e.g., `prod`, `dev`)
2. Creates/patches flags in **destination** environments (e.g., `production`, `development`)
3. Applies to both flags and segments automatically
4. Validates that destination environments exist before starting

**Notes:**
- Only mapped source environments will be migrated
- Destination environments must already exist in the target project
- If a mapped destination environment doesn't exist, migration will abort with error
- Environment keys are case-sensitive
- Can be combined with `-e` flag for additional filtering

**Error handling:**
```bash
# If destination environment doesn't exist:
Error: The following mapped destination environments don't exist in target project:
  prod → production (destination "production" not found)
Available destination environments: dev, staging, test
```

### Environment Filtering

By default, the migration script migrates **all environments** from the source project. You can selectively migrate only specific environments using the `-e` flag:

**Usage examples:**

```bash
# Migrate only production environment
deno task migrate -p SOURCE_PROJECT -d DEST_PROJECT -e "production"

# Migrate only non-production environments
deno task migrate -p SOURCE_PROJECT -d DEST_PROJECT -e "development,staging,test"

# Test migration with just one environment
deno task migrate -p SOURCE_PROJECT -d test-project -e "development" -c "test-"
```

**Example output:**
```
=== Environment Filtering ===
Requested environments: production, staging
Matched environments: production, staging
Migrating 2 of 5 environments

Segment migration is enabled
Getting Segments for environment: production
Getting Segments for environment: staging

Reading flag 1 of 50 : my-feature
  Creating flag: my-feature in Project: DEST_PROJECT
  Finished patching flag my-feature for env production
  Finished patching flag my-feature for env staging
```

**Notes:**
- Only the specified environments will be migrated for both flags and segments
- If an environment doesn't exist in the source, you'll see a warning
- If none of the requested environments exist, the migration will abort
- Environment keys must match exactly (case-sensitive)

### Combining Features

You can combine all features for powerful migration workflows:

```bash
# Full-featured migration with environment mapping
deno task migrate \
  -p legacy-project \
  -d modern-project \
  --env-map "prod:production,stg:staging" \
  -c "legacy-" \
  -v "legacy-migration" \
  -m

# This will:
# 1. Map legacy env names (prod → production, stg → staging)
# 2. Migrate flags/segments with environment mapping applied
# 3. Handle conflicts by prefixing with "legacy-"
# 4. Link all flags to "legacy-migration" view
# 5. Map maintainer IDs from source to destination

# Or combine environment filtering with mapping
deno task migrate \
  -p SOURCE_PROJECT \
  -d EXISTING_PROJECT \
  -e "prod,dev" \
  --env-map "prod:production,dev:development" \
  -c "v2-" \
  -v "migration-batch-1" \
  -m

# This will:
# 1. Only migrate prod and dev environments from source
# 2. Map them to production and development in destination
# 3. Handle any conflicts by prefixing with "v2-"
# 4. Link all flags to "migration-batch-1" view
# 5. Map maintainer IDs
```

## Reverting Migrations

If you need to undo a migration (e.g., after a failed or partial migration), you can use the revert functionality to clean up migrated resources.

### Revert Methods

**Via Workflow (Recommended):**
```bash
# Preview what will be reverted (dry-run)
deno task workflow -f examples/workflow-revert-and-migrate.yaml

# Execute the revert
# Edit the config to set dryRun: false, then run again
```

**Via Individual Revert Task:**
```bash
# Preview revert with config file
deno task revert -f examples/revert-migration-example.yaml --dry-run

# Execute revert
deno task revert -f examples/revert-migration-example.yaml

# Or use CLI arguments
deno task revert -p SOURCE_PROJECT -d DEST_PROJECT -v "migration-view" --dry-run
```

### What Gets Reverted

The revert process:
1. **Identifies migrated flags** - Uses source data to know exactly which flags were migrated (smart mode)
2. **Deletes approval requests** - Removes any pending approval requests for migrated flags
3. **Unlinks from views** - Removes flags from the target view
4. **Archives flags** - Archives migrated flags before deletion
5. **Deletes flags** - Permanently removes migrated flags from destination
6. **Cleans up segments** - Removes migrated segments (if they were migrated)
7. **Optionally deletes views** - Can remove the view itself (with `--delete-views` flag)

### Revert Configuration

**YAML Config Example:**
```yaml
source:
  projectKey: source-project

destination:
  projectKey: dest-project

migration:
  targetView: "migration-2024"  # View to clean up

revert:
  dryRun: true                   # Preview first (recommended)
  deleteViews: false              # Set to true to also delete views
  # viewKeys:                     # Optional: Only revert specific views
  #   - migration-view-1
```

### CLI Options

- `-p, --projKeySource`: Source project key (identifies which flags to revert)
- `-d, --projKeyDest`: Destination project key (where flags will be deleted)
- `-v, --targetView`: View key containing migrated flags
- `--dry-run`: Preview the revert without making changes
- `--delete-views`: Also delete the view after unlinking all flags
- `--no-use-source-data`: Disable smart mode (scan all destination flags instead)
- `-f, --config`: Path to YAML configuration file

### Revert Workflow Examples

**Revert and Re-migrate Pattern:**
```yaml
# workflow-revert-and-migrate.yaml
workflow:
  steps:
    - revert      # Clean up previous migration
    - migrate     # Run migration again with corrected settings

source:
  projectKey: source-project

destination:
  projectKey: dest-project

revert:
  dryRun: true    # Change to false after previewing

migration:
  assignMaintainerIds: true
  targetView: "migration-2024"
  dryRun: true    # Change to false after previewing
```

**Best Practices:**
1. **Always use `--dry-run` first** to preview what will be deleted
2. **Use smart mode** (default) - leverages source data for faster, more accurate reverts
3. **Back up critical flags** if you're unsure about the revert scope
4. **Preview the re-migration** with dry-run before executing

### Example Revert Output

```
=== REVERT MIGRATION (DRY RUN) ===
Source project: source-project
Destination project: dest-project
Target view: migration-2024

Found 50 flags in source data
Checking which flags exist in destination...

Would revert the following resources:
  - flag: my-feature-1
  - flag: my-feature-2
  - flag: feature-x
  ... (47 more)

Would delete 3 pending approval requests
Would unlink 50 flags from view "migration-2024"
Would delete 50 flags
Would delete 5 segments

Set dryRun to false to execute the revert.
```

## Using Deno Tasks

The project includes predefined Deno tasks for easier execution. These tasks are
configured in `deno.json` and include all necessary permissions.

## Notes for the use of the scripts

- The migration process is one-way and cannot be reversed automatically
- Flag Maintainer IDs are different between the account instances and must be mapped
  using the `map-members` script before migration
- Environment names and keys must match between source and destination projects
  when migrating to an existing project
- The destination project can either be new or existing:
  - For new projects: All environments will be created automatically
  - For existing projects: Only environments that exist in both projects will be migrated
- Segment migration can be skipped using the `-s=false` flag if needed
- Unbounded (big) segments are automatically skipped during migration
- The tool uses a fixed API version (20240415) which may need to be updated for
  future LaunchDarkly API changes
- The tool includes rate limiting to comply with LaunchDarkly API limits. This
  means it can take some time before the migration script finishes executing if
  there is a large number of resources to be migrated. You can use the
  `estimate` task to get an estimate of how long the migration will take.

## Pre-Migration Checklist

1. **Data Assessment**
   - What flags and segments need to be migrated?
   - Can you use this as an opportunity to clean up unused resources?
   - Experiments, guarded or randomised (percentage-based) rollouts can't be
     migrated while maintaining consistent variation bucketing. These types of
     releases should ideally be completed before the migration takes place.

2. **Access and Permissions**
   - Do you have API access to both source and destination account instances?
   - Have you created the necessary API keys?
   - Do you have sufficient access to create projects in the destination account?

3. **Maintainer Mapping**
   - Have all the members who are set as maintainers in the source account been
     added to the destination instance?
   - Are the member emails matching across the account instances?
   - Have you created the maintainer ID mapping file?

4. **Timing and Execution**
   - When is the best time to perform the migration?
   - How will you handle ongoing changes during migration?
   - Do you need to maintain consistent state between source and destination account
     instances after the migration? If so, for how long?

## Known Issues

- TypeScript types are loose due to API client limitations, particularly in
  handling API responses. The tool uses `any` type in several places due to
  LaunchDarkly API response structure variations
- Custom integrations and webhooks need to be manually reconfigured for the new
  account instance after the migration
- The tool does not support the migration of experiments or percentage-based
  rollouts while maintaining consistent variation assignment pre- &
  post-migration

## Flag Import From 3rd Party Sources

The project includes a **Flag Import Tool** that allows you to bulk create feature flags in LaunchDarkly using JSON or CSV files. This is particularly useful for:

- Setting up new projects with predefined flags
- Migrating flags from other systems
- Standardizing flag configurations across projects
- Bulk flag creation for development/testing

### Quick Start

1. **Use the provided template files**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the template files to get started
   cp examples/flags_template.json my_flags.json
   cp examples/flags_template.csv my_flags.csv
   
   # Edit the copied files with your flag definitions
   # Or create your own files in the import-files directory
   ```

2. **Ensure your API keys are configured**:
   ```bash
   # The import-flags script uses the same API key configuration as other scripts
   # Make sure config/api_keys.json contains your destination account API key
   cp config/api_keys.json.example config/api_keys.json
   # Edit config/api_keys.json with your API keys
   ```

3. **Import flags**:
   ```bash
   # Using deno task (recommended)
   # The script automatically looks in data/third-party-migrations/import-files/
   deno task import-flags -f my_flags.json -p PROJECT_KEY

   # Or using deno run directly
   deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-write src/scripts/third-party-migrations/import_flags_from_external.ts -f my_flags.json -p PROJECT_KEY
   ```

### File Formats

#### JSON Format
```json
[
  {
    "key": "flag-key",
    "name": "Flag Name",
    "description": "Flag description",
    "kind": "boolean",
    "variations": [true, false],
    "defaultOnVariation": true,
    "defaultOffVariation": false,
    "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]
  }
]
```

#### CSV Format
```csv
key,name,description,kind,variations,defaultOnVariation,defaultOffVariation,tags
flag-key,Flag Name,Flag description,boolean,"true,false",true,false,"tag1,tag2"
```

⚠️ **Important**: CSV import is only suitable for non-JSON flag types (boolean, string, number). For flags with JSON variations or complex nested structures, use the JSON format instead.

### Supported Flag Types

- **boolean**: Simple on/off flags with true/false variations
- **string**: Text-based flags with multiple string options
- **number**: Numeric flags with number variations
- **json**: Complex configuration flags with JSON object variations

### Features

- **Validation**: Comprehensive input validation before import
- **Dry-run mode**: Test your configuration without creating flags
- **Rate limiting**: Automatic rate limiting to comply with LaunchDarkly API limits
- **Detailed reporting**: Success/failure summary with optional JSON report
- **Error handling**: Clear error messages for troubleshooting

### Requirements

- **Target project must exist**: The LaunchDarkly project specified with `-p PROJECT_KEY` must already exist in your account
- **API key with write permissions**: Your `destination_account_api_key` in `config/api_keys.json` must have permission to create flags in the target project
- **Consistent with other scripts**: Uses the same API key configuration as LD-to-LD migration scripts

### Examples

```bash
# Dry run to validate configuration
deno task import-flags -f flags.json -p myproject -d

# Import with detailed report
deno task import-flags -f flags.json -p myproject -o import_report.json

# Import from CSV file
deno task import-flags -f flags.csv -p myproject

# Use template files from examples folder
deno task import-flags -f examples/flags_template.json -p myproject -d
```

## Version Management

This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and maintains a [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for tracking changes.
